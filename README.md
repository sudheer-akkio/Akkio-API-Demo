# Feedback

- No utility to inspect already created model to grab field importance, data story, etc...
- Need to create new model in order to grab any meta info from insights report
- How to track dataset IDs -- Currently every data manipulation creates a new dataset -- would be nice to add timestamp or version or info on changes made to the data?
- Ability to query status of a model that is being trained (not listed in list of models)
- API flow shows up in UI but you can't click into it
